Welcome to your Spring Boot CRUD application! This document provides information on running and building this project, understanding its structure, and contributing to its development.

Project Overview:

This project is a Spring Boot application implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on [Entity Name] entities. It utilizes Spring Data JPA for data persistence and exposes RESTful APIs for managing data.

Running the Project:

Prerequisites:

Maven 3.8.1 or later
Build and Run:

Clone the repository.
Run mvn clean package to build the project.
Run java -jar target/<project-name>.jar to start the application.
Accessing the API:

Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using your preferred REST client:

List all entities: GET /api/v1/[entity-plural]
Get a specific entity: GET /api/v1/[entity-plural]/[entity-id]
Create a new entity: POST /api/v1/[entity-plural] (body with entity data)
Update an existing entity: PUT /api/v1/[entity-plural]/[entity-id] (body with updated entity data)
Delete an entity: DELETE /api/v1/[entity-plural]/[entity-id]
